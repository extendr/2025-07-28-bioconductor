-   [extendr-api](https://extendr.github.io/extendr/extendr_api) - the “core” Rust library
-   [extendr-ffi](https://extendr.github.io/extendr/extendr_ffi) - bindings to R’s C API
-   [extendr-engine](https://extendr.github.io/extendr/extendr_engine) - R engine for embedding R into Rust

## extendr packages

-   16 CRAN packages
-   Many, many more on GitHub ![](images/paste-3.png)
